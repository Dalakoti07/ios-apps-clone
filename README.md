## This is netflix clone

Trying to get hang of Swift UI tool kit, and I would say its doped!

## Opinions as an android developer on IOS development
## The Goods

- Swift UI Kit is much cooler than expected, and even compose I would say, not sure why they came up with the 
concept of Swift UI
	- Lot of things are out of box:
		- toolbar, bottom nav, everything takes minimal setup
		- search view controller is out of box, I mean in android we have code that
- if u code mindfully dark and light themes are handled automatically with `systemColor` or `system{...}`, for 
that we have to theme setup for android separately
- data is not lost when going from a fragment of bottom nav to another frag of bottom nav ðŸ˜‚, RIP android devs. 
Even multi back stack is also handled ðŸ”¥
- 

## The Bads

- Xcode looks great on outside, but its shitty when compared to Android Studio
	- Different key bindings
	- error telling late and resolution late as well
- Cannot see documentation for overriden functions
- only 1 import for the whole file, `import uiKit` I mean why uiKit was made that way?
- in extensions when providing implementation, for `UiCollectionViewDelegate` and `UiCollectionViewDataSource` 
we override lots of function like override 1 fun for telling total rows, 1 fun for telling cols in each row. 
- Stuff object mismatch crashing at runtime, in android it happens at compile time
- Error messages are mystry most of the times
