## This is netflix clone

Trying to get hang of Swift UI tool kit, and I would say its doped!

## How to run project
Create a env.plist file and make entry of api keys for youtube and tmdb, see ProjectEnv.swift for details

## Scope of improvement
- [ ] Add progress bar in each screen
- [ ] Make api call in details screen, current implementation does api beforehand and on success goes to next 
screen
